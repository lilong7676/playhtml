_interactive, collaborative html elements with a single data attribute_

playhtml is a library for magically creating collaborative interactive HTML elements that persist their state across sessions. For example, you can create a movable piece of HTML "furniture" by adding the `can-move` attribute:

```html
<div can-move style="font-size: 80px">🛋</div>
```
